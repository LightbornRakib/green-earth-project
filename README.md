var is function scoped, let and const are block scoped.
var is hoisted, let and const are not hoisted.
var can be reassigned, let can be reassigned, but const cannot be reassigned. 

2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

map() returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.
forEach() executes a provided function once for each array element.
filter() returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions.
They do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target.
They are always anonymous.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring assignment is a special syntax in JavaScript that allows us to extract data from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way.
It is a way to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals are a way to embed expressions inside strings.

They allow us to use string interpolation to embed expressions inside strings.
They allow us to use multi-line strings without using escape characters.
